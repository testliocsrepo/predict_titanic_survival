# Titanic_dataset_prediction_project
In this Project we want you to use the Titanic passenger data (name, age, price of ticket, etc.) for predicting who will survive and who will die. The requirement is to predict passengersâ€™ survive. Prediction is to build a model which takes input data and produce an output.
